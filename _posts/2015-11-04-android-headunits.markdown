I've been contemplating putting an Android headunit in my car lately.
It would solve the constant problem of GPS Navigation and have a decent music player.

This is a video about the Pumpkin C-0250, that is probably what i'm going to get:

As you can see, it can be updated with a custom ROM available at [xda-developers][xda-developers], so it can be rooted quite easily.
